# Configuration

This document covers config options that change game behavior beyond model/runtime settings.

## CLI config override file

You can layer an additional YAML file on top of `config.default.yaml` and `config.yaml` at startup:

```bash
node server.js --config-override ./tmp/local.override.yaml
```

You can also use:

```bash
node server.js --config-override=./tmp/local.override.yaml
```

Merge precedence is:

1. `config.default.yaml`
2. `config.yaml`
3. `--config-override` file

The override file must exist and contain a YAML object. Invalid or missing files fail startup with a clear error.
If the server is started with `--config-override`, `reload_config` keeps using the same override file.

## Per-game YAML override

The `/config` page also exposes a per-game YAML override textarea for the currently loaded save.

Merge precedence becomes:

1. `config.default.yaml`
2. `config.yaml`
3. `--config-override` file
4. current game's YAML override

Rules:
- The per-game override must contain a YAML object when non-blank.
- Blank input clears the per-game override for the loaded game.
- Editing the field triggers the same runtime reload path used by `/reload_config`.
- The raw YAML is saved as `gameConfigOverride.yaml` inside the save and is reapplied before save hydration on `/api/load`.
- Starting a brand-new game clears any previous loaded-save override before world generation begins.
- Like `/reload_config`, mod enable/disable changes are validated immediately but still require a restart to fully change the active mod set.

## Mod enablement

You can enable or disable discovered mods from the merged YAML config:

```yaml
mods:
  need-bar-hydration:
    enabled: false
  sceneIllustration:
    additional_instructions: "..."
```

Rules:
- `mods` must be an object when present.
- Each `mods.<name>` entry must be an object when present.
- `mods.<name>.enabled` must be a boolean when present.
- Missing `enabled` defaults to `true`.
- This merged-config value takes precedence over `mods/<name>/config.json` `enabled`.
- Disabled mods are skipped for `mod.js` loading, defs overlays, and `public/` asset serving.
- The active mod set is frozen at startup, so changing mod enablement on disk still requires a server restart to apply. `/reload_config` reports drift but does not hot-toggle mods.

## AI custom args

`config.ai.custom_args` lets you inject structured top-level request arguments into every LLM chat-completion payload.

```yaml
ai:
  custom_args:
    thinking:
      type: disabled
```

Rules:
- `custom_args` must be an object when present.
- Keys are merged into the request payload before the standard core fields are applied.
- Reserved top-level payload keys are rejected in `custom_args`: `messages`, `model`, `seed`, `stream`, `max_tokens`, `temperature`, `top_p`, `frequency_penalty`, `presence_penalty`.

### Override behavior (`ai_model_overrides`)

`ai_model_overrides.<profile>.custom_args` is merged per argument key (deep object merge), rather than replacing the entire `custom_args` object.

```yaml
ai_model_overrides:
  dialogue_generation:
    prompts: [player_action]
    custom_args:
      thinking:
        type: disabled
```

Merge semantics:
- Object values merge recursively by key.
- Non-object values replace previous values.
- Arrays replace previous arrays.
- `null` deletes the targeted key from the inherited `custom_args` tree.

## AI request headers

`config.ai.headers` lets you inject HTTP headers into every LLM chat-completion request.

```yaml
ai:
  headers:
    User-Agent: "Firefox 99.0"
```

Rules:
- `headers` must be an object when present.
- Header names must be non-empty strings.
- Header values must be strings.

Header precedence:
1. built-in defaults (`Authorization`, `Content-Type`)
2. `ai.headers`
3. per-call `LLMClient.chatCompletion({ headers })`

### Override behavior (`ai_model_overrides`)

`ai_model_overrides.<profile>.headers` is merged per header key (not replaced as a whole object).

```yaml
ai_model_overrides:
  dialogue_generation:
    prompts: [player_action]
    headers:
      User-Agent: "Firefox 99.0"
```

Merge semantics:
- Header keys are merged per key across matching profiles.
- `null` on a specific header key removes that inherited header key.
- `headers: null` clears inherited headers for that override chain.

## AI prompt cachebuster

`config.ai.cachebuster` prepends a random cachebuster line to the final `user` message sent by `LLMClient.chatCompletion()`.

```yaml
ai:
  cachebuster: true
```

- Must be a boolean when present.
- When `true`, each outbound request attempt gets a fresh line in the form `[cachebuster:<uuid>]` before the final `user` message body.
- The original caller-provided `messages` array is not mutated; the tag is applied only to the request payload copy.
- The live prompt-progress viewer and chat-completion error logs reflect the cachebusted prompt actually sent on that attempt.

## AI retry wait after errors

`config.ai.waitAfterError` controls how many seconds to wait between automatic retry attempts after retryable non-rate-limit failures (`5xx`).
`config.ai.waitAfterRateLimitError` is a specific override used for rate-limit failures (`429`).

```yaml
ai:
  retryAttempts: 3
  waitAfterError: 10
  waitAfterRateLimitError: 10
```

- Must be a non-negative number.
- `0` disables the delay between retries.
- If unset, the default is `10`.
- Can be overridden per prompt via `ai_model_overrides.<profile>.waitAfterError` (using that profile's `prompts` selection).
- `waitAfterRateLimitError` falls back to `waitAfterError` when unset.
- `waitAfterRateLimitError` can also be overridden per prompt via `ai_model_overrides.<profile>.waitAfterRateLimitError`.
- Per-call `LLMClient.chatCompletion({ waitAfterError })` still takes precedence over config values when explicitly provided.
- Per-call `LLMClient.chatCompletion({ waitAfterRateLimitError })` takes highest precedence for rate-limit retries.

## Character creation point pools

`config.formulas.character_creation` controls the formulas used to calculate the base point pools for the New Game attribute and skill allocators.

```yaml
formulas:
  character_creation:
    attribute_pool_formula: "level * (number_of_attributes / 2)"
    skill_pool_formula: "level * ceil(number_of_skills / 5)"
    max_attribute: "infinity"
    max_skill: "infinity"
```

### Variables

- `level`
- `number_of_attributes`
- `number_of_skills`
- `attribute.<name>.value` (ex: `attribute.intelligence.value`)
- `attribute.<name>.bonus` (ex: `attribute.intelligence.bonus`)
- `attribute_modified.<name>.value` (ex: `attribute_modified.intelligence.value`)
- `attribute_modified.<name>.bonus` (ex: `attribute_modified.intelligence.bonus`)
- `skill.<name>` (ex: `skill.lockpicking`)
- `infinity` (constant = 1e100)

Attribute/skill names are normalized to lowercase with non-alphanumeric characters replaced by underscores (for example, `Two-Handed Weapons` becomes `skill.two_handed_weapons`). Normalization is Unicode-aware: letters and digits from any script are kept, so localized names work too (for example, `Знание Городской Навигации` becomes `skill.знание_городской_навигации`).
`attribute.*` always reflects base values; `attribute_modified.*` reflects modified values (if supplied).

### Functions

- `abs`, `round`, `floor`, `ceil`
- `min`, `max`, `clamp(value, min, max)`

### Notes

- The formulas compute the **base** pool. Existing spend/refund logic still applies:
  - Attributes: lowering a stat below 10 refunds points; raising above 10 spends points.
  - Skills: ranks above 1 spend points.
- `max_attribute` and `max_skill` are evaluated as caps for New Game allocation inputs.
- When the Player Stats page loads without a player, the skill formula is used to set the default unspent points.
- Invalid formulas throw errors and block the allocator until corrected.

## Player level-up ability selection

Two config keys control player-only level-up ability drafting:

```yaml
player_ability_options_per_level: 6
player_abilities_per_level: 3
```

- `player_ability_options_per_level`: how many ability cards/options are shown per level draft.
- `player_abilities_per_level`: how many abilities the player must submit for that level.
- Both values must be positive integers.
- `player_abilities_per_level` cannot exceed `player_ability_options_per_level`.
- NPC level-up ability assignment remains automatic; this config applies only to the player draft modal flow.

## Extra plot prompt toggles

`extra_plot_prompts` gates the automatic hidden story-note schedulers for plot summary, plot expander, supplemental story info, and offscreen NPC activity.

```yaml
extra_plot_prompts:
  plot_summary: true
  plot_expander: true
  supplemental_story_info: true
  offscreen-npc-activity-daily: true
  offscreen-npc-activity-weekly: true
```

- Missing keys default to `true`.
- Each populated key must be a boolean; invalid values raise a runtime error when scheduling.
- Disabled categories do not auto-schedule and do not advance that category's cadence counters while disabled.
- These toggles only affect automatic scheduling. Manual slash-command plot note runs (`/runplotsummary`, `/runplotexpander`) still work.

## Supplemental story info prompt frequency

`supplemental_story_info_prompt_frequency` controls when hidden supplemental story-info prompts run after a player turn.

```yaml
supplemental_story_info_prompt_frequency: 5
```

- `0`: never run supplemental story info prompts.
- `>0`: run every `X` turns (`X` = configured value), and also run on any turn where one or more new NPCs or things (items/scenery) were generated.
- Automatic scheduling is also gated by `extra_plot_prompts.supplemental_story_info`.
- Value must be an integer `>= 0`; invalid values raise a runtime error when scheduling the prompt.

## Offscreen NPC activity prompt count

`offscreen_npc_activity_prompt_count` controls the twice-daily hidden "what are they doing right now" NPC activity prompt size.

```yaml
offscreen_npc_activity_prompt_count: 5
```

- Runs when world time crosses `07:00` and `19:00`.
- The configured value controls how many non-present NPCs the twice-daily prompt requests.
- `0` disables the twice-daily prompt.
- Automatic scheduling is also gated by `extra_plot_prompts.offscreen-npc-activity-daily`.
- Weekly offscreen NPC activity still runs independently (fixed at 15 NPCs).
- If elapsed time crosses multiple scheduled offscreen prompt checkpoints in one turn, only one offscreen prompt is run for that turn.

## Offscreen NPC activity max turns between prompts

These caps force an offscreen NPC activity run if too many turns pass without that cadence firing.

```yaml
offscreen_npc_activity_daily_max_turns_between_prompts: 20
offscreen_npc_activity_weekly_max_turns_between_prompts: 100
```

- `offscreen_npc_activity_daily_max_turns_between_prompts`:
  - Applies to the twice-daily cadence.
  - When the daily prompt is enabled (`offscreen_npc_activity_prompt_count > 0`), reaching this many turns since the last daily run forces one daily run.
- `offscreen_npc_activity_weekly_max_turns_between_prompts`:
  - Applies to the weekly cadence.
  - Automatic scheduling is also gated by `extra_plot_prompts.offscreen-npc-activity-weekly`.
  - Reaching this many turns since the last weekly run forces one weekly run.
- `0` disables turn-cap forcing for that cadence.
- Values must be integers `>= 0`; invalid values raise runtime errors when scheduling.
- Single-run-per-turn still applies: if multiple offscreen prompts are due in one turn (time-based and/or turn-cap based), only one is run.

## World time

`time` controls the canonical world clock configuration. Internally, the server tracks world time in minutes (`worldTime.timeMinutes`), and config inputs are also minute-based.

```yaml
time:
  cycleLengthMinutes: 1440
  tickMinutes: 15
  segmentBoundaries:
    dawn: 360
    day: 480
    dusk: 1080
    night: 1200
```

- `cycleLengthMinutes`: total minutes in a full day cycle.
- `tickMinutes`: baseline tick value for systems that need default advancement.
- `segmentBoundaries`: map of `segmentName -> startMinute` within the cycle.
- Segment boundaries must be within `[0, cycleLengthMinutes)`.

## Image generation thing size overrides

`imagegen.default_settings.image` remains the baseline size for generated item and scenery images. You can optionally override those dimensions per thing type with `imagegen.item_settings.image` and `imagegen.scenery_settings.image`.

```yaml
imagegen:
  default_settings:
    image:
      width: 1024
      height: 1024
  item_settings:
    image:
      width: null
      height: null
  scenery_settings:
    image:
      width: null
      height: null
```

- `item_settings.image.width` / `height` are optional. `null` or omission falls back to `default_settings.image`.
- `scenery_settings.image.width` / `height` are optional. `null` or omission falls back to `default_settings.image`.
- When provided, override values must be between `64` and `4096`.
- If neither the per-type override nor `default_settings.image` provides a usable width/height, startup validation fails instead of silently hardcoding a fallback size.

## Slop remover base attempts

`slop_remover_base_attempts` controls the starting number of rewrite attempts for the slop-remover pass.

```yaml
slop_remover_base_attempts: 2
```

- Must be an integer `>= 1`.
- This is the base attempt count before parse-failure extensions.
- Parse failures can still increase the effective cap up to 5 attempts.

## Random event frequency and custom types

`random_event_frequency` controls random-event roll chances and supports extensible file-based event types.

```yaml
random_event_frequency:
  enabled: true
  common: 0.05
  rare: 0.01
  party: 0.2
  regionSpecific: 0.06
  locationSpecific: 0.06
```

- `enabled: false` disables random event rolls.
- `locationSpecific` and `regionSpecific` continue to use location/region seed pools (not text files).
- Any other key under `random_event_frequency` is treated as a file-based random event type (excluding control/seed keys: `enabled`, `location`, `region`, `locationSpecific`, `regionSpecific`).
- File-based random event types load from `random_events/<type>.txt` (for example `party` -> `random_events/party.txt`).
- `common` and `rare` remain built-in file-based types and load from `random_events/common.txt` and `random_events/rare.txt`.
- Chance values:
  - `<= 1` are treated as decimal probabilities and converted to percentages.
  - `> 1` are treated as percent values directly.
  - `<= 0` disables that specific type for normal random rolls.

`random_event_frequency_multiplier` scales roll frequency globally and must be a positive number.

## Faction generation count

`factions.count` controls the requested number of factions during new-game generation.

```yaml
factions:
  count: 7
```

- `0` disables faction generation.
- Positive integers request that many factions from the generator.
- If the generator returns more factions than requested, extras are accepted.
- If the generator returns fewer factions than requested, new-game setup fails with an error.
- Active-setting overrides:
  - If the applied setting defines `defaultFactionCount`, that value is used instead of `factions.count`.
  - If `defaultFactionCount` is unset and the setting has `defaultFactions`, the draft count is used.
  - `factions.count` remains the fallback when the applied setting has neither.

## Chat completion sound

`chat_completion_sound` controls the optional realtime sound cue clients play when `/api/chat` completes.

```yaml
chat_completion_sound: assets/audio/bleep.mp3
```

- `null` or `false` disables playback.
- Any non-empty string is treated as the client-playback path.
- The default path resolves to `/assets/audio/bleep.mp3` and requires static serving from the server.

## History windows (`recent_history_turns` vs `client_message_history`)

`recent_history_turns` and `client_message_history` control different history windows:

- `recent_history_turns` affects only base-context prompt assembly (`<recentStoryHistory>` vs `<olderStoryHistory>`).
- `client_message_history` affects only what the web client receives/renders via `/api/chat/history` and initial page load history.

```yaml
recent_history_turns: 10
client_message_history:
  max_messages: 50
  prune_to: 40
```

`client_message_history.max_messages` is interpreted as a **turn cap** (anchored on user entries; assistant prose anchors are used only as fallback when user entries are unavailable). This does not change `recent_history_turns`.

`client_message_history.prune_to` remains a validated config value (`<= max_messages`) for prune-mode flows, but the standard chat-history responses now use `max_messages` turn-capped output so client-visible history length no longer tracks `recent_history_turns`.

## Plot expander cadence

`plot_expander_prompt_frequency` controls automatic hidden `plot-expander` prompt cadence on eligible player-action turns.

```yaml
plot_expander_prompt_frequency: 10
```

- Default is `10` when omitted.
- `0` disables automatic runs.
- Automatic scheduling is also gated by `extra_plot_prompts.plot_expander`.
- Value must be an integer `>= 0`; invalid values raise runtime errors when scheduling.
- Runs use the base-context `plot-expander` include and store hidden `plot-expander` entries.
- The latest `plot-expander` output is injected into base-context as `<plotExpander>` immediately after `<plotSummary>`.
